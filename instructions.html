           There are 12 pairs of cards on the board. 
           You must match up all the pairs to win the game. 
           Select cards two at a time to reveal their creepy content and see if you've found a match.  
           If the cards don't match, they'll get returned to the board.
           So remember where they were and pick again.
           If you fail 3 times in matching, you lose a life.
           If you lose all 3 lives, it's game over for you. 
           Good luck!
